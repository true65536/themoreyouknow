How rice cooker works?
======================

Rice cooker is an amazing tool to get you rice just right easily, but do you
know how it decides when to stop cooking?

Of course, there are more complex rice cookers which may not follow this
principle, right know I'm talking about the cheap and simple rice cookers.

It working principle is simple and brilliant: *it simply checks temperature*

As long as there is water, the temperature won't rise above 100°C / 212°F,
because that is when water start boiling. A part of the water will evaporate,
and the rest will be absorbed by the rice itself. Once the water is all gone,
the cooker bottom will heat the rice, which will go above the water boiling
point, the rice cooker can measure this temperature and it knows there is no
more water, and that rice should be cooked, assuming you have put the right
amount of water!
